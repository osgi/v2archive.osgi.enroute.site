     <p>The OSGi Alliance has released R7 versions of the OSGi specifications. To coincide with OSGi R7, the OSGi Alliance has created <a href="https://enroute.osgi.org/">OSGi enRoute v7</a> which is different in many ways from OSGi enRoute v2 archived on this site. This enRoute v2 archive site is kept as a resource for those already using OSGi enRoute v2. If you are new to OSGi enRoute, then please start with the latest <a href="https://enroute.osgi.org/">OSGi enRoute</a>.</p>

						<h1>Why OSGi enRoute?</h1>
						<p>OSGi is by far the best way to develop software systems and take
							advantage of modularity. However, until now the threshold to get
							started was high due to lack of a good tool chain, proper service
							based libraries, and tutorials, with the consequence that many
							people gave up before the benefits became visible.
						<p>The vision of the OSGi Alliance with the enRoute project is
							therefore to make OSGi as easy as possible for developers to get
							started with OSGi without compromising its core values.

						<h1>What is OSGi enRoute?</h1>
						<p>OSGi enRoute consists of the following aspects:
						<ul>
							<li><b>Community</b> – A growing community (well, any new
								project will easily have a growing community, please join!).
							<li><b>Programming Model</b> – A quite cool, best practice,
								µservice-based development model.
							<li><b>Tool Chain</b> – A selected tool chain that supports
								the OSGi programming model over all the stages of development.
							<li><b>Education</b> – A (hopefully growing) number of
								tutorials and examples.
							<li><b>Incubator</b> – Acts to experiment with future services.
						</ul>

						<h1>How to get started?</h1>
						<p>
							To get a feel for OSGi enRoute the best way to start is doing
							the <a href="/qs/050-start.html">Quick Start</a> tutorial.
						<p>
							If you like what you see, you should try the longer <a href="book/220-tutorial-base.html">base
								tutorial</a>. This is a zero-knowledge required tutorial that guides
							you through all the principles of developing with OSGi enRoute.
						<p>
							If you are an architect and want to know more about what enRoute
							is and does then you start reading the <a
								href="book/210-overview.html">overview</a> of the enRoute
							project.
						<p>
							<!-- If you're interested in the enRoute Profiles, you can find more to
				read in the <a href="book/400-datasheets.html"></a> -->
